# Kimün

Domain language for kimün — a note-taking app split into **core** (file ops, indexing, notes) and a **TUI** (interaction and presentation). This file records terms whose meaning is not obvious from the code alone; general programming concepts do not belong here.

## Language

### Editor parsing

**Parse state**:
The TUI editor's per-buffer parse cache, which is either a **Real parse** or a **Placeholder parse**. Modelled as the `ParseState` enum in the markdown editor view; the distinction exists only to keep typing responsive on large buffers.
_Avoid_: parse mode, parse status

**Real parse**:
A fully-styled `ParsedBuffer` produced synchronously by `pulldown-cmark`. The only parse state on which an incremental **splice** is legal.

**Placeholder parse**:
A structurally-correct but unstyled `ParsedBuffer` installed synchronously when a large-buffer edit trips the incremental cap, so the frame paints immediately; the real parse is deferred to a background task and swapped in when it lands. Splicing into a placeholder is forbidden — its all-`Plain` line kinds would defeat the structural guards and accept a wrong splice.
_Avoid_: stub parse, fake parse, temp buffer

### Editor rendering

The editor is WYSIWYG-ish: it shows styled markdown, not raw source, except on the line currently being edited.

**Sigil**:
The markdown marker characters that signal a construct rather than being read as prose — `#` for headings, `>` for blockquotes, the list bullet/number, the backtick/tilde code fences. The styled view hides or mutes them so the prose reads cleanly.
_Avoid_: marker token, syntax char

**Reveal**:
When the cursor sits on a styled construct, the editor drops the styling for that line and shows the raw markdown (sigils included, muted) so it can be edited directly. The cursor leaving re-applies the styled form. The element-scoped form of this is an **expanded element**.

**Blockquote bar**:
The vertical `│` gutter the editor paints in place of the `>` sigils of a blockquote. One bar per nesting depth, repeated on wrapped continuation rows so the quote reads as a single left-edged block. Replaced by the raw `> ` on the line being edited (see **Reveal**).

**Code box**:
The background rectangle the editor paints behind a code block (fenced or indented). Sized to the block's widest line and capped at the editor width — a box hugging the code, not a full-width band.
