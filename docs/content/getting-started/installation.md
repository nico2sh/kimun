# Installation

## Install Kimün

### Install script (recommended — macOS & Linux)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://kimun.2co.dev/install.sh | sh
```

This is the preferred way to install Kimün. The script downloads the latest
stable release, verifies its SHA-256 checksum before installing, and drops the
binary into `~/.local/bin` (override with the `KIMUN_INSTALL_DIR` environment
variable). It also records an install marker that enables **in-app
self-update**, so you can upgrade from inside Kimün rather than re-running the
installer.

Prefer to read the script before running it? Download and inspect it first:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://kimun.2co.dev/install.sh && less install.sh && sh install.sh
```

If `~/.local/bin` isn't on your `PATH`, the script tells you how to add it.

> **Windows:** the install script is Unix-only. Use the release archive from the
> [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nico2sh/kimun/releases), or install
> with Cargo (below).

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

```sh
brew tap nico2sh/kimun
brew install kimun
```

### Cargo (Rust ecosystem)

```sh
cargo install kimun-notes
```

## Updating

If you installed with the **install script**, Kimün can update itself in place —
the install marker tells the app it's on the `script` channel. Just re-run the
install command at any time to pull the latest stable release:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://kimun.2co.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Installed via **Homebrew** or **Cargo**? Update through the same tool you used:

```sh
brew upgrade kimun        # Homebrew
cargo install kimun-notes # Cargo (reinstalls the latest)
```

## First Run

When you launch Kimün for the first time with no workspace configured, a **guided setup** dialog walks you through choosing a notes directory, Nerd Fonts, a theme, and an editor. Everything is applied in one shot at the end — nothing is written until you confirm.

```sh
kimun
```

See [Guided Setup](@/getting-started/configuration.md#guided-setup) for a step-by-step breakdown.

## Configuration File

The config file is created automatically on first run:

- **Linux / macOS:** `~/.config/kimun/config.toml`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\kimun\config.toml`

You can also specify a custom config path:

```sh
kimun --config /path/to/my-config.toml
```

## Workspace Index

Kimün creates a per-workspace SQLite search index — `<config_dir>/<workspace>.kimuncache` by default. It's the index, not your notes. Your actual notes are plain `.md` files inside the workspace directory. The cache file can be safely deleted; it will be rebuilt automatically the next time Kimün runs.

```
~/.config/kimun/                ← Config directory
├── config.toml                 ← Your config
├── default.kimuncache          ← Search index for the "default" workspace
└── history/
    └── default.txt             ← Recently-opened notes for "default"

your-workspace/                 ← Your workspace directory
├── notes.md                    ← Your notes (plain Markdown)
├── journal.md
└── projects/
    └── my-project.md
```

The cache and history locations are configurable — see [Configuration → Files Kimün Stores on Disk](@/getting-started/configuration.md#files-kimun-stores-on-disk).

## Optional: the Kimün Server

Kimün can pair with an optional companion server that adds **semantic search**
and **AI question-answering** over your notes. It's a separate binary,
currently installed with Cargo only — see
[Semantic Search & Ask](@/using-kimun/server.md) for installation and setup.
Kimün works fully without it.

## What's Next

You're installed. Now learn your way around the [Terminal UI](@/using-kimun/tui.md), or set up separate [Workspaces](@/getting-started/workspaces.md) for work and personal notes.
